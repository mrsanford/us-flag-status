# Why is the US Flag at Half-Staff Today?

*Ever driven by the McDonald's down the street, seen the US flag flying outside the building and wondered-- why is the flag half-staff today? You could spend time googling and trying to find the answer, or you could input your relevant information (the data and location), and get the answer faster.*

This tool provides historical half-staff tracker data from 2019 to present with up-to-date tracking. It accounts for permanent, regular occurences including Peace Officers Memorial Day, Armed Forces Day, Patriot Day, National Firefighters Memorial Day, and Pearl Harbor Rememberance Day. [Gettysburg Flag Works](https://www.gettysburgflag.com/fly-flag-half-mast) provides more comprehensive dates, rules, and practices.

### Real-Time, Location-Based Half-Flag Updates
Half-staff rules and dates are outlined in the Flag Code; however, they may also be issued upon presidental or a state governor's proclamation. As a result, half-staff status on non-nationwide dates will vary by state and US territory.
