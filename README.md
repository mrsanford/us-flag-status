# Why is the US Flag at Half-Staff Today?

Ever drive by the McDonald's down the street, see the US flag, and wonder why the flag is at half-staff? This project allows users to input relevant information (date and location), and it will return *why* the flag is half-staff. You could look it up-- but you could also use the tool.
